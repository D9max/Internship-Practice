												online shopping system

Here's a report for the mini project in Java that models a simple online shopping system:
Project Overview

The online shopping system is a Java-based application that allows users to view products, add them to a shopping cart, and check out. The system utilizes inheritance, interfaces, overriding, collections, and custom exceptions to provide a robust and user-friendly experience.
Features

User authentication: Users can create an account and log in to the system.

Product catalog: Users can view a list of available products and their details.

Shopping cart: Users can add products to a shopping cart and view the total cost of their order.

Checkout: Users can complete their order by providing their shipping and payment information.

Custom exceptions: The system handles errors and exceptions gracefully, providing users with helpful error messages.

Implementation Details

The online shopping system is implemented in Java using object-oriented programming principles. The system utilizes inheritance to create a hierarchy of product types, interfaces to define common behaviors, and overriding to customize behavior for specific product types. Collections are used to store and manage product and user data, and custom exceptions are used to handle errors and exceptions.
Conclusion

The online shopping system is a robust and user-friendly application that provides users with a seamless shopping experience. The system utilizes a variety of Java features and techniques to provide a flexible and extensible architecture.
